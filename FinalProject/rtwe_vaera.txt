<P>At the beginning of this week's <i>parsha</i>, <i>Hakadosh
Baruch Hu</i>, in speaking to Moshe <i>Rabbienu</i>, invokes His promise to
give <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> to the <i>avos</i>, Avraham, Yitzchok, and Yaakov. In
so doing <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> refers to <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> as <i>eretz meguraihem</i>,
the land of their sojourning. The word <i>meguraihem</i> is related to the word
<i>ger</i>, sojourner. Malbim explains that a Jew's ultimate home is not
in this physical world, but rather in the spiritual world in spiritual
proximity to Hashem. Thus, we are strangers in this world. <i>Eretz Yisroel</i>
- <i>eretz meguraihem</i> - is the land most suitable for sojourners because of
its inherent sanctity.</p>

<P>The Torah reiterates this point in <i>parsha Behar</i> when
it stipulates that "The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the
land is Mine; for you are sojourners and residents with Me" (<i>Vayikra</i>
25:23, Stone ed. translation).</p>

<P>We intuitively sense that one element of being responsible
is planning for the future. We disapprovingly shake our heads when we see
someone profligately spending without a thought for the future. We have savings
accounts, retirement accounts, etc. And, of course, such planning is prudent
and thus appropriate. But are we equally prudent in planning for our ultimate
future? Do we live with alacrity and industriousness, recognizing the
inestimable, incomparable value of time? Do our priorities reflect the fact
that we live in <i>eretz meguraihem</i>, that we are only sojourners and
residents? Do we prepare for our eternal future?</p>
